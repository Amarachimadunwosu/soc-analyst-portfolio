# about me 
I am an MSc Cybersecurity student with a strong interest in Security Operations (SOC), threat detection, and incident response.
I have hands on experience working with SIEM tools to monitor security events, analyze logs, and investigate suspicious activity across networks and systems. I regularly work with event logs, firewall logs, and network traffic to identify potential threats and understand attacker behavior
My practical learning approach involves building home labs, simulating real-world attacks in controlled environments, and performing log analysis to detect brute-force attempts, malware activity, and unauthorized access. I am comfortable using SIEM dashboards, creating alerts, and correlating events to support security investigations.
This GitHub portfolio showcases my hands on cybersecurity projects, including SOC analyst simulations, SIEM and firewall log analysis, network scanning, and incident response exercises. Each project documents my methodology, findings, and security recommendations.
My career goal is to secure a junior SOC Analyst role where I can contribute to monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats while continuing to develop my skills in defensive cybersecurity.
